# Implementation of the Stack Data Structure in Java

## Introduction

This project aims to deeply understand the concept, functionality, and applications of the **Stack** data structure in programming. It develops skills for its efficient implementation and proper use in different scenarios.

## Objectives

### General Objective

-   Understand the concept, functionality, and applications of the **Stack** data structure, developing skills for its correct implementation and usage in programming.
    

### Specific Objectives

-   **Apply implementation techniques** for the Stack using different approaches, such as linked lists or other data structures.
    
-   **Develop skills to identify and solve problems** related to the implementation and use of the Stack, including debugging and optimization.
    
-   **Explore practical applications** of the Stack in common programming problems, such as processing mathematical expressions, reversing strings, and memory management.
    

## Technologies and Tools Used

-   **Programming Language:** Java 19 and 20
    
-   **Development Environment:** Apache NetBeans 14, 15, and 16
    
-   **Version Control:** GitHub, GitHub Desktop
    

## Concept: What is a Stack?

A **Stack** is an ordered data structure with a **LIFO** (_Last In, First Out_) access mode, meaning that the last element entered is the first to be removed.

### Basic Stack Operations

-   **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    
-   **Pop:** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
    
-   **Peek:** Returns the top element without removing it.
    
-   **isEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty.
    

### Stack Applications

-   Evaluation of expressions in postfix notation.
    
-   Context-free language syntax analyzers.
    
-   Recursion implementation.
